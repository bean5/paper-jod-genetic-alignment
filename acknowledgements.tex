A big thank-you is in order for Dr. Liddle who provided an online means for Dr. Galbraith to build our gold standard. Additionally, I thank Dr. Lddle for being my advisor and for being personally vested in this work. 

I thank my wife for being my best friend. She is always ready to provide a nudge to get me going again when times get tough (such as when your database gets corrupted or locks up).

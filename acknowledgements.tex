A big thank-you is in order for Dr. Liddle who provided an online means for Dr. Galbraith to build our gold standard. 

Dr. Galbraith did the hard work of detecting thousands of imitations, then used an online tool produce by Dr. Liddle to align the imitations.

I thank my wife for being my best friend. She is always ready to provide a nudge to get me going again when times get tough (such as when your database gets corrupted or locks up).

Plagiarism or paraphrase detection is a field of study with plenty room for improvement. Recent studies have achieved decent accuracies. This study aims to improve upon the alignment of detected instances of plagiarism or paraphrase. Herein we use a modified Wunch genetic alignment algorithm to allow for more auto-adjusting costs for the genetic alignment operations: indel, match, replace). We show that our algorithm improved upon the default alignment (end of page/paragraph) errors by x\%. We use a database of over 2000 human-annoted gold standard \_\_\_\_. This means that on average, our algorithm can take a poor alignment (aligned to the end of paragraph or page) and re-align it to anywhere in the paragraph.

Anonymous native speakers of English Qualtrics survey respondents (32 total, female and male, ages 18-32):
 	\begin{quote}
 		$t()=, p < 0.$ when \_\_\_\_\_
 		
 		$t()=, p < 0.$ when \_\_\_\_\_
 	\end{quote}  

Although we only produce metrics for the right end of the alignments, this is only done because it is what our gold standard provided.

The work of author attribution is applicable and researchable in both secular and non-secular fields. This is true regardless of whether the plagiarism is an exact quote, non-exact quote, paraphrase, or allusion. Collectively, we refer to these as \textit{imitations} or \textit{citations}. First we compare various genetic alignment algorithms and their performance. Then we use their output as well as other metadata of the citations to perform a k-means clustering.

We do not detect imitations; we only aim to align them. We prove that all algorithms produce better alignments than the baseline error of xyz\%.

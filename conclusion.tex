\section {Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

Although machine learning on top of genetic outputs did not always perform better (the case for the perceptron), for high order machine learning models such as back-propagation-trained multi-layer perceptron and bagging decreased mean average error significantly. Training a bagging model ran much faster than training an MLP.  The best MAE was achieved using a bagging approach, resulting in an MAE that was 45\% lower than baseline MAE.

Future work might achieve even better results, but this work demonstrates that machine learning using meta-data from genetic alignments can prove to be powerful, efficient, and helpful.

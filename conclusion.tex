As seen in \ref{tab:c1}-\ref{tab:overall_ml}, in every case the perceptron outperforms the now-vanilla genetic alignments. Furthermore, these figures show that the higher order model provided by the BP-MLP are even more efficient. They are nearly half of baseline error and have 40\% lower error rates than best overall genetic alignment algorithm.

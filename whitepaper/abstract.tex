The work of author attribution is the subject of research in both secular and non-secular fields. This is true regardless of whether the imitation (plagiarism in extreme cases) is an exact quote, near quote, paraphrase, or even allusion. Herein, we refer to these collectively as \textit{imitations}.% or \textit{citations}.
 We compare various genetic alignment algorithms and their performance with respect to baseline, each other, and with respect to the type of imitation. (Error was always better than baseline and random errors.) We use their output as well as other metadata from their alignments to train a neural network using back-propogation. This model achieves a better accuracy than any 1 of the models alone, achieving an errors as low as 60\% of baseline error and 50\% of random error. 

%Although we do not detect imitations, we align them. 
We prove that all selected algorithms produce better alignments than the baseline error across all imitation classes. Furthermore, we show that they can be combined in a BP-trained MLP to produce even lower error.

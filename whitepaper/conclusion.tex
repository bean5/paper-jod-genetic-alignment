When used as input to a perceptron, the overall error decreases for every genetic alignment algorithm. Further, when used as input to a multi-layer perceptron, the errors further decrease. In every case the perceptron outperforms the now-vanilla genetic alignments. The BP-MLP RMSE is nearly half of baseline error at 151.

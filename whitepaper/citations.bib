	journal = {Proc. SPIE},

	pages = {86580R-86580R-11},
	abstract = {
	For noisy, historical documents, a high optical character recognition (OCR) word error rate (WER) can render the OCR
	text unusable. Since image binarization is often the method used to identify foreground pixels, a body of research seeks
	to improve image-wide binarization directly. Instead of relying on any one imperfect binarization technique, our method
	incorporates information from multiple simple thresholding binarizations of the same image to improve text output. Using
	a new corpus of 19th century newspaper grayscale images for which the text transcription is known, we observe WERs of
	13.8% and higher using current binarization techniques and a state-of-the-art OCR engine. Our novel approach combines
	the OCR outputs from multiple thresholded images by aligning the text output and producing a lattice of word alternatives
	from which a lattice word error rate (LWER) is calculated. Our results show a LWER of 7.6% when aligning two threshold
	images and a LWER of 6.8% when aligning five. From the word lattice we commit to one hypothesis by applying the
	methods of Lund et al. (2011) achieving an improvement over the original OCR output and a 8.41% WER result on this
	data set.

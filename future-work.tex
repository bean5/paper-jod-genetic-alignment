\section {Future Work}
%\textbf{}
This work can be used for future work in several ways. Following are some examples 
	\begin {itemize}
		\item test error rates of the same method, but using a different language
		\item detect new paraphrases (generation)
		\item classify type of paraphrase (classification) perhaps by using machine learning
		\item remove duplicate citations
		\item [Insert more here]
	\end {itemize}
The possibilities for future work is apparent. 

Future work need not focus on only one of the above at a time.  Studies could perform two or more of the above if desired.

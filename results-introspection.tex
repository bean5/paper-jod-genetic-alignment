\subsection {Introspection Responses} Although no major gender differences in answers were detected by this study, the survey asked respondents to answer an introspective question.  The question was “Has your view of opposite changed because of this survey?”  Figures 5.8 and 5.9 show responses (by gender) to the question.

In spite of the fact that gender differences are not experienced in free-form responses, women apparently believe that they are more in-tune with the way that antonymy functions in English.  This is the only gender difference discovered in this study, although it would not be surprising if there were gender differences in selection of opposites for words which most women are familiar with which most men would not be familiar.

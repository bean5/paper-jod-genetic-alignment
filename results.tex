\subsection {Analysis} 
%Since $H_{1}$ concerns the mean count of xyz for each word, a one-tailed Student's Independent \textit{t}-test will be used here to determine whether the mean count of xyz for nouns are statistically significantly greater than those for adjectivs.  The threshold for significance adopted here is $0.01$.  


\subsection{Overall Error}
Table xyz %~\ref{algorithmsTotalError} 
shows the overall error for each algorithm.

Overall, the best algorithm was \#xyz while the worst was \#xyz. 

\subsection{Error By Imitation Class}
Tables xyz-xyz %~\ref{alg1totalerror}-~\ref{alg8totalerror} 
show the error for each algorithm, for each imitation type.

Table xyz %~\ref{theoreticalCombinedError} 
shows the lowest error achieved for each imitation type.

%Tables~\ref{tab:all_adjective}, \ref{tab:all_noun} show the normalized responses and total counts for each set of xyz while Table~\ref{tab:all_group_stats} shows the group statistics for the two groups.

%The Welch's \textit{t}-test agrees that there is significance (equal variance not assumed):%

%\subsection{}
%Since there were few responses from men (only 9), it seems that running the same \textit{t}-test on the responses without the male responses could be of interest as well.  Tables~\ref{tab:female_adjective}, \ref{tab:female_noun} show the normalized responses and total counts for each set of xyz while Table~\ref{tab:female_group_stats} shows the group statistics for the two groups.


%The calculated statistic is as follows (equal variance not assumed):
%$t(7.881)=3.55902, p < 0.00461577$

\subsection {Analysis} 
Since $H_{1}$ concerns the mean count of antonyms for each word, a one-tailed Student's Independent \textit{t}-test will be used here to determine whether the mean count of antonyms for nouns are statistically significantly greater than those for adjectivs.  The threshold for significance adopted here is $0.01$.  

Two sets of results will be presented for two data sets: (1) including males and female responses, and (2) including only female responses.  The reason that there is no third data set including only male responses is that that there would only be 9 data points in the dataset, which is less than 10.  (The minimum for the \textit{t}-test is 10.)

\subsection{Female and Male Responses}
Tables~\ref{tab:all_adjective}, \ref{tab:all_noun} show the normalized responses and total counts for each set of antonyms while Table~\ref{tab:all_group_stats} shows the group statistics for the two groups.

The calculated statistic is as follows:
	\begin{quote}
		$t(8)=4.16415, p < 0.00157362$
	\end{quote}

\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
									& \textbf{Adjectives} 	& \textbf{Nouns}  \\ \hline \hline
			\textbf{Mean} 			& 5.20					& 11	\\
			\textbf{SD} 			& 1.30					& 2.828	\\
			\textbf{Std. Err. Mean} & 0.583					& 1.265	\\
			\textbf{N} 				& 5						& 5		\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption {Group Statistics.}
	\label{tab:all_group_stats}
\end{table}


The Welch's \textit{t}-test agrees that there is significance (equal variance not assumed):
	\begin{quote}
		$t(5)=4.1642, p < 0.00439413$
	\end{quote}


\subsection{Female Responses Only}
Since there were few responses from men (only 9), it seems that running the same \textit{t}-test on the responses without the male responses could be of interest as well.  Tables~\ref{tab:female_adjective}, \ref{tab:female_noun} show the normalized responses and total counts for each set of antonyms while Table~\ref{tab:female_group_stats} shows the group statistics for the two groups.



\input{results-female-responses}

The calculated statistic is as follows (equal variance not assumed):
	\begin{quote}
		$t(7.881)=3.55902, p < 0.00461577$ 
	\end{quote}


\begin{table}

									& \textbf{Adjectives} 	& \textbf{Nouns}  \\ \hline \hline
			\textbf{Mean} 			& 4.00					& 7.80	\\
			\textbf{SD} 			& 1.581					& 1.789	\\
			\textbf{Std. Err. Mean} & 0.707					& 0.80	\\
			\textbf{N} 				& 5						& 5		\\
			\hline

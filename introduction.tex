\section {Introduction (and Inspiration/Motivation)}

The work of author attribution is applicable and researchable in both secular and non-secular fields. This is true regardless of whether the plagiarism is an exact quote, non-exact quote, paraphrase, or allusion. Collectively, we refer to these as imitations or citations. First we compare various genetic alignment algorithms and their performance. Then we use their output as well as other metadata of the citations to perform a k-means clustering.

In this work, we do not detect imitations; we only aim to align and classify them.

Our primary, or imitable documents, include The Holy Bible KJV, The Holy Bible JST (Joseph Smith Translation), The Book of Mormon, The Doctrine and Covenants, The Pearl of Great Price as sources. Secondary, or imitating documents, that are aligned to the primary documents entail religious discourse texts, 26 volumes of the Journals of Discourse from the 19th (20th?) century. Using a database of pre-aligned citation alignment, type, and scripture reference, we compare various algorithms in terms of error rate. %and perhaps other metrics 
[For error measures: We focus on only the right position of the alignments since we aim to insert citations where it seems most appropriate for them.] We then determine whether any of the genetic algorithms have the least error for each type of citation.

After determining which version of genetic algorithm works best for each type of citation, we use the metadata of the citations and alignments to cluster them. We found that there were xyz clusters, each corresponding to exact quote, non-exact, paraphrase, or allusion. This empirically demonstrates that given just xyz algorithms, we can discern between types of attribution that is called for. It is not outside the realm of possibilities for future work to use this technique to classify work at run-time before making a conclusion as to the badness of the imitation attempt.

This study aims to prove the following hypothesis:
	\begin{quote}
		$H_{1}:$ The error of any of our genetic algorithms is better than the baseline error (xyz\%).

		$H_{2}:$ Given the meta-data of the text, we can classify the type of imitation with xyz\% accuracy.

		$H_{3}:$ Given various genetic algorithms, an ANN can be trained to produce lower error rates on citation alignments than either of them alone.
	\end{quote}

Herein we also show the classification confusion matrix for type of imitation, which is not revelatory, but informative nonetheless.  [Future work: also show the meta-data profile, including a word-length histogram, word-token-length histogram, etc.].

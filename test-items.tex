\section{Test Items}
The words used to elicit antonyms are provied in Table~\ref{tab:key-words}.  The reason that these adjectives were chosen is that they are fairly non-ambiguous (except in the case of \textit{hot}) and well-known.  The same is true for the nouns.  The adjectives are highly abstract while the nouns are concrete and visible so much so that you can probably search for pictures of each of them online and \textit{see} them.
